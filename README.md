# Portfolio: Telco Customer Churn

This repository holds in my first project to be shown in my personal data science's portfolio. It works with a dataset of a fictional telco company that provides home phone and internet services. It indicates which customers have left (churned), stayed or signed up for their service in the last month, and several features about them.

The original dataset is provided by IBM Cognos Analytics.

## Data

It consist in 6 .xlsx files, and can be found at https://github.com/guillepaez53/portfolio-telcochurn/tree/main/data

## Notebooks

They can be found at https://github.com/guillepaez53/portfolio-telcochurn/tree/main/notebooks

## What's done

Up to date, the repository consist in an extensive Notebook which includes a complete EDA and Data Curation. It does its best to find the relationships between several pairs of features, and between these features and the target (whether the customer churns or not), in order to explain these patterns as clear as possible.

## What's coming

A few Notebooks with different Statistical and Machine Learning models trying to find accurate predictions for the target.
